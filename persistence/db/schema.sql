-- MySQL 8.x DDL for the ER diagram (Account, Listing, Offer, Comment, Rating)
-- This schema models a simple marketplace where:
-- - Accounts can post listings
-- - Other accounts can make offers on listings
-- - Accounts can comment on listings
-- - A listing can be sold to one buyer, and ONLY that buyer can leave ONE rating

-- Notes / Design decisions:
-- - Primary keys are BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT for compact, fast indexing and joins.
-- - All tables use ENGINE=InnoDB to support transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys.
-- - Foreign keys use ON DELETE CASCADE / ON UPDATE CASCADE so deleting a parent row cleans up related rows.
-- - TEXT is used for fields where we do not want to set an explicit maximum length.
-- - Monetary values use DECIMAL(10,2) to avoid floating-point rounding errors.
-- - Timestamps default to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for automatic creation time capture.

-- Relationship mappings (cardinality + FK columns):
-- * Account (1) posts Listing (M)
--     listing.seller_id → account.id
--
-- * Listing (1) has Offer (M)
--     offer.listing_id → listing.id
--
-- * Account (1) sends Offer (M)
--     offer.sender_id → account.id
--
-- * Listing (1) has Comment (M)
--     comment.listing_id → listing.id
--
-- * Account (1) writes Comment (M)
--     comment.author_id → account.id
--
-- * Listing (1) gets Rating (0..1)  (one rating per listing, because one buyer)
--     rating.listing_id → listing.id   (UNIQUE on listing_id enforces at most one rating per listing)
--
-- * Account (1) gives Rating (M)
--     rating.rater_id → account.id
--
-- * Listing (0..1) is sold to Account (0..M)
--     listing.sold_to_id → account.id

-- Deletion behavior (due to ON DELETE CASCADE):
-- - Deleting an Account deletes:
--     • Listings they posted (and all offers/comments/ratings under those listings)
--     • Offers they sent
--     • Comments they wrote
--     • Ratings they made
--     • Listings where they were the buyer (sold_to_id) will also be deleted (since it cascades)
--
-- - Deleting a Listing deletes:
--     • All offers on that listing
--     • All comments on that listing
--     • The rating on that listing (if present)
--
-- Business rules enforced by triggers:
-- - A listing cannot be marked sold (is_sold=TRUE) unless sold_to_id is set.
-- - A rating can only be inserted/updated if the listing is sold AND the rater is the buyer.
-- - One rating per listing is enforced by UNIQUE(listing_id).
